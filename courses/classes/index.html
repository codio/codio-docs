<h3 id="creating-new-course-from-share-code">Creating new course from share code<a class="headerlink" href="#creating-new-course-from-share-code" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>You can create courses from a code other users in other organisations can share to you. A relationship between your course and those created using the share code will be established so any updates/changes you may make in your course content can be pulled in by the other users. See <a href="/courses/classes/#working-with-masterchild-courses">working with master/child courses</a> below for more information</p>
<ol>
<li>Select the <strong>Add From Share Code</strong> option</li>
</ol>
<p><img alt="Share Course Dash" src="/img/manage_classes/sharecode.png" /></p>

<h4 id="working-with-masterchild-courses">Working with Master/Child courses<a class="headerlink" href="#working-with-masterchild-courses" title="Permanent link"></a></h4>
<p>Where you have cloned a course or created using a share code, there will be a relationship between the original (Master) course content and the clone (Child) course content so that if you have need to edit/update an assignment in the master course these changes can be pulled into the child courses.</p>
<p>After publishing the updates from the original course, you can send notifications so that teachers (not 'read only' teachers) in the course will see a banner advising them of the available updates.</p>
<h5 id="updating-and-sending-notifications-to-child-courses">Updating and sending notifications to child courses<a class="headerlink" href="#updating-and-sending-notifications-to-child-courses" title="Permanent link"></a></h5>
<p>To send notifications, go to the <strong>Admin</strong> tab and select <strong>Send New Notification</strong></p>
<p><img alt="Notify Child Courses" src="/img/manage_classes/notifychild.png" /> </p>
<p>where you can then enter a notification message to assist teachers in the child course to understand what changes have been made available and can be updated</p>
<p><img alt="Send Notification" src="/img/manage_classes/sendnotification.png" /> </p>
<p>This message can include details of all the changes made in each assignment or just be a summary. If a summary used and the teachers in the child course wish to check the changes made for individual assignments, they can <strong><a href="/courses/classes/#updating-and-not-sending-notifications-to-child-courses">pull</a></strong> the assignments to review the information entered in the publish assignment changelog</p>
<p>The history of all notifications sent for published updates in the master course can be seen selecting the <strong>View Sent Notification</strong></p>
<p>Where notifications have been sent, teachers will then see an icon on the course view</p>
<p><img alt="Course Update List" src="/img/manage_classes/courseupdatelist.png" /> </p>
<p>and when accessing the course, details of the notification changes available in the associated child course</p>
<p><img alt="Course Update Banner" src="/img/manage_classes/courseupdates.png" /> </p>
<p>Clicking on <strong>Show Changes</strong> will then show details of the assignments updated tagged with the parts of the assignment that have been updated</p>
<p><img alt="Course Update Details" src="/img/manage_classes/detailcourseupdates.png" /> </p>
<p>Clicking on the <strong>?</strong> for updated part will show information on the meaning of the tags</p>
<p><img alt="Tag Meanings" src="/img/manage_classes/tagmeaning.png" /> </p>
<p>Clicking on <strong>Update History</strong> will show the notification message sent for that update</p>
<p>Select the assignments you wish to update and <strong>Apply</strong>. A confirmation dialog will be shown for you to confirm you wish to update the assignments</p>

<p>After publishing the update from the original course, go to the cloned course where (in 'edit' mode) you will see the option to Pull for the individual assignments.</p>
<p><img alt="Pull" src="/img/manage_classes/pull.png" /></p>
<p>Details will be shown of the update published in the original course to allow for confirmation and on acceptance the update will be pulled in to the assignment in the cloned course.</p>
<p><img alt="Update" src="/img/manage_classes/updatedialog.png" /></p>
<p>You can also <strong>Pull All</strong> to pull all updates available for each module but be aware this will not show you the details for each updated assignment. To see this information, use the individual <strong>Pull</strong> for the assignment.</p>
<p><img alt="Pull All" src="/img/manage_classes/pullall.png" /> </p>
<p>The option to pull at the module or individual level will only be shown if an update to the assignment has been published in the original course.</p>

<h2 id="searching-and-ordering-courses">Searching and ordering courses<a class="headerlink" href="#searching-and-ordering-courses" title="Permanent link"></a></h2>
<p>Courses are shown grouped together by their creation date with the most recently created first.</p>
<p>The grouping intervals are</p>
<ul>
<li>Sep-Dec - Autumn</li>
<li>Jan-May - Spring</li>
<li>Jun-Aug - Summer</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="ordering-courses-within-their-groups">Ordering courses within their groups<a class="headerlink" href="#ordering-courses-within-their-groups" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>

<h3 id="searching">Searching<a class="headerlink" href="#searching" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>If you have a large number of courses, you can also search by Name, Created Date, Student Count or Start Date. Select the appropriate option and simply start typing, whereupon Codio will search within all course names and filter your list accordingly.
<img alt="Name" src="/img/manage_classes/nameclass.png" /></p>
<h3 id="add-as-a-tab">Add as a Tab<a class="headerlink" href="#add-as-a-tab" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>

<h3 id="archiving-courses">Archiving Courses<a class="headerlink" href="#archiving-courses" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>To help manage the number of courses visible to teachers they can be archived so they no longer show on the active screen for teachers and in the students dashboard the course will show as archived and their assignments will be read-only. Go to the 3 blue dot menu and select 'Archive Course'. You will then be prompted to confirm your action by typing in a phrase 'make-read-only'</p>
<p>Archiving a course does not effect students being able to see their grades/feedback but they will not be able to continue working on assignments.  They are not deleted and can be unarchived at any time in the future if they are required either by clicking on the course in the archived tab or from the 3 blue dot menu and selecting 'Unarchive Course'</p>
<h2 id="adding-teachers-to-a-course">Adding teachers to a course<a class="headerlink" href="#adding-teachers-to-a-course" title="Permanent link"></a></h2>

<p>You can add students to your organization and your course easily by giving each student a unique two-word phrase called a token or by giving them in Student Invite URL.  A student will enter the token and will automatically be added to the your organization and the correct course as they complete the process to create a Codio account.  To do this follow the steps below:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>From the <strong>Courses</strong> area, click on your course to open it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click on the <strong>Students</strong> tab, top centre of your screen.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><img alt="Students Tab" src="/img/manage_classes/students_tab.png" /></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Click on the <strong>Add a student</strong> button.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can then send the 2 word token to your students or send them the Invite URL to join the course or you can add the Test students to your course. We recommend you use the <strong>Invite URL</strong> to avoid students going through the process to create a new organisation where they may click on the <strong>Free Trial</strong> button in error. There maybe a delay in us being able to get back to them to advise them of the correct steps to take but if you use the Invite URL, they should be able to get started a lot quicker.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><img alt="Add Students" src="/img/manage_classes/addstudents.png" /></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>If using the token then ask them to go to <a href="https://codio.com/p/join-class">https://codio.com/p/join-class</a> or select the <strong>Join Course</strong> button on our main website. They should enter the token when requested and proceed to register for a Codio account.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If using the URL, the students can just click that and proceed as above.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To view the students in your course, select the course and the <strong>Students</strong> tab once again. You will see a list of students who have successfully completed the sign-up process.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Please note:</strong> If your course is LTI enabled, students cannot be added this way to avoid them having duplicate accounts with different registered email addresses. They do so by logging into the LMS and when accessing an assignment an account will be created for them.

<p>Click the <strong>New</strong> button in the to right to create a new template. You should then add rows and columns.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Rows</strong> : a row addresses a single assessment criterion. Each row has a weighting % value that you should supply. All rows must add up to 100%.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Columns</strong> : each column contains a score that you can freely assign. Typically, you would have a 0 value in the first column that corresponds to a complete failure to address the criterion. The remaining columns contain a range of values that you choose with the right most column being the score for fully meeting the assessment criterion. Please read the following paragraph before choosing column values.</p>

<p>When you are grading student code, the grading rubric will appear and is clickable. Points are awarded according to where you click. Codio will then weight the scores according to the weightings that were provided for each row.</p>
<p>A final score is calculated based on your selections and is re-based to the maximum column value. You should be aware of this when choosing your column values. If you wanted your scores to calculate directly to percentages then you should choose a maximum value of 100 with other column values distributed between 0 and 100.</p>

<p>A Gigabox is a box that has a higher memory allocation than the standard Codio boxes. The default memory allocation is 512MB, which is fine for most applications.</p>
<p>If you need your students to have more memory then we offer 1GB, 2GB, 8GB,16GB and GPU (for GPU-accelerated instances) boxes. These need to be purchased separately and you can add any number of either box size to your organization. You will need to specify the Gigabox size and then each student accessing the assignment will have a Gigabox for that assignment. </p>
<p>You can set the required Gigabox in your project or assignment in the course module and this setting will be automatically applied to the assignments as you add the module into a course. If students have already started the assignment, the gigabox settings will be applied to their assignment when they next run the assignment.</p>
<p>You should be aware that if you do not have enough Gigaboxes in your organization then they will be allocated on a first come, first served basis. Students who access the assignment after your Gigabox limit has been reached will see a warning.</p>
<p>An organization owner can see the status of the Gigabox count in the organization settings screen.</p>
<h2 id="assign-a-project-to-the-course">Assign a project to the course<a class="headerlink" href="#assign-a-project-to-the-course" title="Permanent link"></a></h2>
<p>In Codio, a teaching assignment is a project that has been assigned to a course. The scope of an assignment is entirely up to you but it could be a project assignment that a course works on. It could also be some tutorial content built using Guides. We generally recommend that it relates reasonably closely to a lesson or two. But if you prefer and it suits your structure better then you can assign as much or as little content to a Unit as you like.</p>
<p>There are two ways you can assign an assessment to a course.</p>
<h3 id="assign-a-project">Assign a project<a class="headerlink" href="#assign-a-project" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>The simplest and quickest thing you can do is to assign one of your projects to a course. Once assigned, we refer to it as an assessment but the assessment's source is simply a project.</p>
<ul>
<li>With the course selected, click on the Assessment tab at the top of the page. The list will be empty at this point.</li>
<li>Now click the <strong>+</strong> button in the top left.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Empty Module</strong> and create a new module.</li>
<li>When created click <strong>Add Assignment</strong> and then select <strong>Project Based</strong></li>
<li>From here you can either start creating a new project or import projects in.</li>
<li>To import an existing project see: </li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="" src="/img/import.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Then select <strong>Copy Project</strong> and your project will show. If you have other projects in your <strong>My Projects</strong> area you can browse to select one of them.</li>
<li>At this point you can set the name of the assignment (by default it will be the name of your project with 'copy' appended) and add a description if you wish.</li>
<li>When ready, click the <strong>Create</strong> button and the assignment will be added to the course module.</li>
<li>To create a new assignment, select your starting point (the stack you wish to start from) and you can create your assignment. For more information on authoring your content, strategies etc, see <a href="/courses/coursemanagement">creating course content</a></li>
<li>For the assignments to be visible to your students, you need to <strong>Publish</strong> the assignment. </li>
<li>To publish your assignment, either press the <strong>Publish</strong> button visible in the assignment or go to <strong>Education-&gt;Publish Assignment</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="" src="/img/publish.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Any changes you make in future to assignments will not be visible to students until you publish again. Details of previously published versions is available in the log area.</li>
</ul>
<p>At this point, we take a snapshot of your source project, ready for the students to clone when they start the assignment. Any changes you make to the source project will not be reflected automatically in the student assignment.</p>
<p>Once assigned to the course, each student will be able to access the assignment from their dashboard. Go to the <strong>Students</strong> tab and login as one of the test students. Make sure you have the correct course and module selected form the dropdowns. You will now see the assignment in the list. If you don't, make sure the module dropdown has the correct module name selected.  You can then switch back to your teacher account.</p>
<h3 id="assign-existing-modules-to-the-course">Assign existing modules to the course<a class="headerlink" href="#assign-existing-modules-to-the-course" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>You can assign existing course modules and all of its assignments to your course with a single action.</p>

<p>It is recommended that you connect your assignments to a remote repo (GitHub/BitBucket etc) where you can push your work. As well as giving you full versioning control it also allows you to </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>easily update assignments where you may use the same content in different courses as you can make the changes in one assignment, push to the repo and then pull in the changes to the other assignments to publish.

<p><strong>Please note</strong> the code workspace can be updated with new files added but existing files will not be updated as this can invalidate work for students who have already started the assignment. Any students who haven't started the assignment will see the updated content but for those that have already started the assignment they will not. </p>
<p>To enable students who have started the unit to see the new content, the assignment can be <strong>Reset</strong> (see <a href="/courses/classes/#actions-area-settings">Actions Area Settings</a> for more information) but be aware that any existing work they may have done will be lost.</p>
<h3 id="updating-stack">Updating Stack<a class="headerlink" href="#updating-stack" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>If changes to the stack used in the assignment are required, when completed (and tested) remember to update your stack before publishing. Either create a new version of the stack if you have permissions or create a new stack. See <a href="/project/stacks/#modifying-a-stack">Modifying a stack</a> for more information.</p>
<p>Most assessment changes can be safely upgraded but if you have altered the structure of a question (for example multiple choice changed from single response to multiple response) then student response data can be invalidated.</p>
<p>Any changes to guides content can be applied. You should be careful about making major structural changes as students who have already started the assignment could be confused. The code workspace folder will not be impacted, so any student work in this folder will not be impacted.</p>

<p>This allows you to pin or unpin an assignment. Pinning an assignment ensures that the assignment is shown in a large box at the top of the student dashboard. You would typically pin an assignment if this is the assignment you are currently teaching. When you have finished teaching it, you would unpin it. You should not have more than four assignments pinned.</p>
<p><img alt="Pinned" src="/img/pinned.png" /></p>
<h4 id="disableenable-assignment">Disable/enable assignment<a class="headerlink" href="#disableenable-assignment" title="Permanent link"></a></h4>
<p>You can enable or disable assignments that have been assigned to a course. This is useful when your students are working in controlled assessment conditions and you only want them to have access to their work within a prescribed timeframe.
For book based assignments, you should be aware that if another assignment gives access to the book then students can access the book. and if the student is able to access the terminal window or see the file tree then access to areas that you intend to be disabled cannot be guaranteed. For project assignments and normal projects, preventing access can be guaranteed.</p>
<h4 id="visibility-on-completed">Visibility on completed<a class="headerlink" href="#visibility-on-completed" title="Permanent link"></a></h4>
<p>You can specify the students ability to access the assignment when completed. <strong>Not available for book based assignments</strong></p>

</ul>
<h4 id="disable-mark-as-completed">Disable Mark as Completed<a class="headerlink" href="#disable-mark-as-completed" title="Permanent link"></a></h4>
<p>Disabling will not allow students to mark the assignment as completed. If assignments in your course are of a ‘playground’ type where you allow students to experiment with their code, this can be useful to disable to avoid them completing the assignment in error and then having to ask the teacher/instructor to change the status back so they can continue working.
If your assignment contains guides content, you should also disable the option to show Mark as Completed button in guides</p>
<h4 id="reset-assignment-by-student">Reset Assignment by Student<a class="headerlink" href="#reset-assignment-by-student" title="Permanent link"></a></h4>
<p>You can allow students to be able to reset their assignments in the course to start again. All work they may have done will be lost.</p>

<p>Once the stop date and time is reached you can set the assignment to be marked as complete and/or disabled. If you elect to disable access, then depending on your <a href="/courses/classes/#disableenable-assignment">disabled assignment settings</a> students will either be refused all access or can have read-only access to the assignment.</p>
<p>Please note, that selecting mark as complete will not stop students who have not started the assignment from being able to access the assignment after the stop date/time has been reached. If you wish to manage this, look at using the disable assignment and mark as complete option.</p>
<p>For book based assignments, you should read the caveats mentioned in the <strong>Disable/enable assignment</strong> section above.</p>

<p>2: If a student presses a Modify button past a deadline</p>
<p><code>Deadline X (the table row number) has been reached. This deadline carries a penalty of Y%. If you proceed, a Y% penalty deduction will be applied to your overall results. You will then be able to modify as many questions as you like with no additional penalty</code></p>
<p>3: Final deadline (assignment end date)</p>
<p>Once the final deadline hits (if one is set), the assignment will be forced to read-only and then following message will be displayed to the student :</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Single Login</strong> - Once a student has started this assignment, until they mark it as complete, all other account login attempts will be blocked. </p>
<p>As students start the assignment, they will be advised that it is restricted to single login and to ensure</p>
<ol>
<li>They have closed other tabs or browsers with Codio open</li>
<li>They have a stable internet connection</li>
<li>They have enough power in their device</li>

<p>These are relative weightings against all 3 grade options. </p>
<p>You can set any number for these. For example, if
the teachers grading has weight 2 and assessments grading has 1, that means the final grade will be calculated like <code>(teachersgrading_points * 2 + assessmentgrading_points * 1) /3</code>. </p>
<p>If you have only one option enabled 100% of the points of the enabled grading will go to the final grade.</p>

<p>If your assignment includes <a href="/courses/assessments/">assessments</a> this will be enabled by default. If you do not wish the results of the assessments to be included in the grading you can disable this.</p>
<p>You can also set the weighting for this. </p>
<h4 id="script-grading">Script Grading<a class="headerlink" href="#script-grading" title="Permanent link"></a></h4>
<p>This allows you to specify an auto-grade script that should run when the assignment is marked as complete. The default setting ensures that any grades generated from auto-graded assessments and grades from free text assessments are automatically transferred into the grading field.</p>
<p>You can also set the weighting for this.</p>
<p>An assignment is marked as complete in any of the following ways</p>
<ol>
<li>Students mark the assignment as complete from their dashboard.</li>
<li>The teacher can also mark the assignment as complete for a student from the Course dashboard with the assignment selected.</li>
<li>The teacher can mark all assignments as complete for all students by pressing the <strong>Actions</strong> button. This button appears on the assignment screen.</li>
<li>If you are using the <strong>Assignment Duration</strong> feature, all student assignments are marked as complete as soon as the assignment duration expiry date and time is reached.</li>

<h4 id="running-an-auto-grade-script">Running an auto-grade script<a class="headerlink" href="#running-an-auto-grade-script" title="Permanent link"></a></h4>
<p>To populate the grading field, you write your own custom script that evaluates the student code. This script can then transfer the grading value into the grading field.</p>
<p>If you are using an LMS platform with Codio then be sure to write a percentage value into this field to maintain compatibility with LMS gradebooks. This grading field is then transferred into your LMS gradebook once you <a href="/courses/grading/#releasing-grades">release the grades</a>.</p>
<p><a name="securescripts"></a></p>
<h4 id="secure-scripts">Secure scripts<a class="headerlink" href="#secure-scripts" title="Permanent link"></a></h4>
<p>If you want your scripts to run securely such that the student has no way of either viewing the script or viewing other files that might contain secure data then you should place those scripts and files in the <code>.guides/secure</code> folder. Codio ensures that only the original project author is able to access this folder but when it is assigned to Students as an assignment, it is not accessible in any way and the script runs in an ephemeral container isolated from the students assignment.</p>
<h4 id="timeout">Timeout<a class="headerlink" href="#timeout" title="Permanent link"></a></h4>
<p>Your script must execute within 3 minutes or a timeout error will occur.</p>
<h4 id="accessing-authored-content-assessment-results">Accessing authored content assessment results<a class="headerlink" href="#accessing-authored-content-assessment-results" title="Permanent link"></a></h4>
<p>You are able to get scores attained by students in authored content based autograded assessments. This data is in JSON format and can be accessed from the <code>CODIO_AUTOGRADE_ENV</code> environment variable. Below is an example.</p>
<pre><code>{

<p>From the <strong>Actions</strong> area of the assignment, you can regrade all students that have already been auto-graded by pressing the <strong>Regrade All</strong> button. This is useful if you have found a bug in your grading script.

<p><strong>IMPORTANT</strong>: please read this section carefully.</p>
<p>We provide a way of testing autograding scripts when authoring your project. This is described below. You should make use of this before publishing your project to a course.</p>
<p>You should be aware that once the assignment has been published to the course, any changes made to the assignment's source project are not automatically reflected in the published assignment. As a result, if you include your main grading logic within the project itself and if that script has bugs, you will not be able to fix the bugs without deleting the assignment, fixing the bug and finally republishing the assignment. All student data will be lost as a result. However, if all your scripts are stored in <code>.guides/secure</code> folder, you can update and test them and you can then publish the new version.</p>
<p>Another strategy is to use a simple bootstrap launcher that loads and executes the script from a remote location that you can edit and debug independently of the Codio box.</p>
<p>The following example bash script shows a Python script that is located as a Gist on GitHub. This script might be called <code>.guides/secure/launcher.sh</code>.</p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/bash
URL=&quot;https://gist.githubusercontent.com/MaximKraev/11cd4e43b0c43f79d9478efbe21ba1b9/raw/validate.py&quot;
curl -fsSL $URL | python - $@
</code></pre>

<p>It is important that it is located in the <code>.guides/secure</code> folder. You then specify the full filepath <code>.guides/secure/launcher.sh</code> in the <strong>Set custom script path</strong> field in the assignment settings.</p>
<p>You are now free to debug the Python script and fix any bugs that you may have noticed once students have started work on the assignment.</p>
<h4 id="testing-your-script-in-the-ide">Testing your script in the IDE<a class="headerlink" href="#testing-your-script-in-the-ide" title="Permanent link"></a></h4>
<p>We provide the ability to test your autograding script from the <strong>Education -&gt; Test Autograde Script</strong> menu.</p>
<p>This option lets you specify the location to your autograding script and run it against the current project contents. It also lets you simulate scores attained by any autograded assessments located within the Codio Guide and select which autograded assessments to test.</p>
<p><img alt="authtoken" src="/img/autograde-test.png" /></p>
<p>You should be aware of the following points.</p>
<ul>
<li>When you press the <strong>Test Script</strong> button</li>
<li>all output to <code>stdout</code> and <code>stderr</code> are displayed within the dialog</li>
<li>the grade as returned by your test script is at the bottom of the output section</li>
<li><code>stdout</code> and <code>stderr</code> output is not available when running for real (not in this test mode) as the autograding script runs invisibly when the assignment is marked as complete. As such, you should generate output for testing and debugging purposes only.</li>
<li>If you want your script to provide any feedback to the student, then you should output it to a file that the student can access when opening the project at a later date. In this case you will need to allow read-only access to the project from the assignment settings after being marked as complete.</li>
<li>Your script must execute within 3 minutes to avoid a timeout error.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the Guide has autograded assessments then the test takes its data from the fields shown in the dialog. All of your assessment settings are accessed as described above under <strong>Accessing Guide assessment results</strong>.</p>

<p>To provide instructors with more robust auto-grade scripts, you can also now </p>
<ul>
<li>Send back feedback in different formats HTML/Markdown/plainText</li>
<li>Allow separate debug logs</li>
<li>Notify (instructors and students) and reopen assignments for a student on grade script failure.</li>
</ul>
<p>To support this additional feedback, this URL (passed as an environment variable) can be used:<code>CODIO_AUTOGRADE_V2_URL</code></p>
<p>These variables allow POST and GET requests with the following parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Grade</strong> (<code>CODIO_AUTOGRADE_V2_URL</code>): 0-100 grade result</li>
<li><strong>Feedback</strong> - text</li>
<li><strong>Format</strong> - html|md|txt - txt is default if used (optional)</li>
<li><strong>Extra Credit</strong> - where extra credit points can be given to students (optional)</li>
</ul>
<p>If the grade is submitted to these urls script output is saved as debug log.
If the script fails, the attempt is recorded, the assignment is not locked (if due date is not passed) and an email  notification with information about the problem is sent to the course instructor(s) containing the debug output from the script.</p>
