The student dashboard is the main ‘home’ area that you use to navigate Codio. This is what it looks like:

![authtoken](/img/what_students_do/studentdashboard.png)

From the **Courses** screen you can view your classes, courses, projects and help by using the links on the left hand panel.

- **STUDY** links give your students access to courses
- **BUILD** links give your students access to project tools and our professional IDE
- **HELP** links give your students access to our customer service team and our help documentation.

## Joining a course

If your course is working with an LMS platform such as Canvas, Blackboard, Moodle etc. then you will access Codio directly from it.

If you are not using and LMS then your instructor should have given you one of the following ways of joining.


- If your teacher has sent you an Invitation URL, copy/paste that into your browser.

- If your teacher has sent you a 2 word token, go to **[Join a course](https://codio.com/p/join-class)** button on our website and enter the token.
![authtoken](/img/joinclass.png)


To access your course after this point, log in to your Codio account and go to the Courses area


## Courses

The **Courses** area is where you can see the modules and assignments that have been assigned to you. Pinned assignments will be displayed more prominently at the top of the page.

Below is an example of a student’s **Courses** area:

![Student Dashboard](/img/what_students_do/studentdashboard.png)

Using the **Courses** area, you can easily re-open the assignment you were last working on, or start/open any of the other assignments that have been assigned to you. You  start or open assignments using the navigation buttons displayed.

## Creating projects

You can create your own projects using the web-based IDE in Codio. To access the project area, use the **BUILD** links in the left-hand navigation panel.

To learn about how to create projects, jump to the main [Creating Project](/project/projects/#creating-and-importing-a-project) section.

## Dyslexia support

Codio has a built in dyslexia support feature. If you have students who would prefer to view their screen in dyslexia support mode they should do the following:

1. Open the assignment they are working on.

1. From the menu at the top right of the screen, select the setting icon (the gear icon), then **Theme**, then select the **Dyslexic** option.
![authtoken](/img/settings.png)

1. The screen should now display like this:
![authtoken](/img/dyslexicview.png)

## Forgotten passwords

If you have forgotten your password, you should use the **lost password** link on the log-in page to reset your password automatically via email. If you do not have access to the email address you used in creating your Codio account, contact your teachers who can reset the password for you.

If you wish to change your password (you should also do this if you forgot your password and/or it was reset by your teacher) follow these steps:

1. Click on your name and profile picture (bottom left of screen)

![authtoken](/img/what_students_do/forgotpassword/profilepic.png)

1. From the options along the top of the page, choose **Account**

![authtoken](/img/what_students_do/forgotpassword/account.png)

1. About halfway down the **Account** page is the **Change Password** area. The student should enter their new password, and then click **Update password**.

## Play mode

To see your content running, you need to *Play* it. If the content does not automatically start or if you have closed it, go to **Tools->Guide->Play** menu option or click the **Start Guide** icon in the file tree:

![StartGuides](/img/guides/startguides.png)

At this point the panel layout is set up automatically according to the layout specified in the first section and it will be displayed.


### Player Options
![Play Mode](/img/guides/playmode.png)


Within the player various options can be controlled by the user


- **Navigation Buttons** allows the user to navigate forward/backward in the content.

- **Settings** allows the user to change the Theme (light/dyslexic), Mark as Complete, change the font size, reset both the theme and fonts and to restore the current files (see below). See [Dyslexia Support](/students/#dyslexia-support) section
- **Show/Hide Section List Hamburger Ico** allows the user to show/hide the section list.

## Guides

### Restore Current Files
Sometimes you might make changes to your work that you don’t like or that you don’t want to keep.

The easiest way to get rid of these is to restore the original files in a assignment.
To do this:

1. Open the assignment you are working on. In the top right, choose the settings icon, and then **Restore current files**
![authtoken](/img/guides/reset.png)

If this does not achieve what you need, you can contact your class instructor who can reset the assignment back to its default state and you can start again as new.

<a name="completed"></a>

### Completing assignments

When you have completed a assignment you can mark it as completed if the content author has not disabled this option for you. This can be done from either:

- In the settings (click the gear icon)

![Complete](/img/guides/complete.png)

- From the last page in the guide.

- Going to **Education>Mark as Completed** menu item in the assignment

If there are any assessments in the assignment that have not been submitted, details of these will be shown to allow you to review them before completing the assignment.


If you mark a assignment as complete in error, contact your class instructor/teacher who can reset the status of the assignment so you can access it again.

### Lexikon

The Codio Lexikon is an integrated help system that lets you lookup information on a variety of languages and topics quickly and easily. Having access to concise reference information as new topics are learned is extremely useful and saves having to search the web and separate the wheat from the chaff!

You can access the Lexikon at any time from within a coding project or assignment if enabled by the author or by going to **Tools>Lexicon** in the top menu. If the top menu is restricted for you, the default keyboard shortcut is **Ctrl+Alt+L**. If that does not open the Lexicon, contact your class instructor/teacher for assistance.

The Lexikon is organized into Topics. We currently have added

- Crunch
- CSS
- HTML
- Javascript
- Linux
- CyberSecurity

## Grade Feedback

When your work has been graded and released by your class instructor, you will see 'graded' showing in your dashboard

![graded work](/img/graded.png)

To view details of the grades given, either open the project and go to **Education>Feedback** in the top menu

![feedback](/img/feedback.png)

or click on the 'Grade' field showing in the dashboard

![access grades](/img/accessgrades.png)

Click on 'details' for the assessment and you can drill down to see more information on that assessment

![grade detail](/img/gradedetail.png)

**Note** If the project has been marked as completed, you can click on the 'completed' button to access the grade feedback but if you wish to view the project, click on the name of the project on the left hand side. As the assignment is completed you will not be able to edit anything but can view the content

If your organisation uses an LMS system a URL of the grading detail will also be passed to your LMS that you can access from the grading area in the LMS.
