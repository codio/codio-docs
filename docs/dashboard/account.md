## Firewall and network settings
Codio can usually run from anywhere in your browser without any special settings. However, some school or university firewall settings may require special configuration.

This page contains information for

- School network system administrators
- Students and teachers who may be using Codio from home

### Firewall settings
The following is a list of ports and URLs that Codio access from time to time. We have put these in priority order.

- __*.codio.com__ the main Codio site and application
- __*.codio.io__ domains that are auto-generated for each user project
- __api.keen.io__ statistics gathering to measure student time spent in units   (stats)
- __*.typekit.net__ web fonts
- __fonts.gstatic.com__ web fonts
- __fast.fonts.net__ web fonts
- __*.cloudfront.net__ our CDN for speeding up static content
- __*.youtube.com & *.vimeo.com__ for video's included in Course content
- __gravatar.com__ used for user gravatars (pictures)

- __*.intercom.io__, __cdnjs.cloudflare.com__ and __*.pubnub.com__ are highly recommended as they relate to  the help and support application (Intercom) built into Codio.

If your institution blocks access to YouTube as a general rule, your IT department can whitelist YouTube access that only allows access to content from registered and accredited educational content repositories. See [here](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2695317?hl=en-GB) for more information on this.


### Ports
We recommend opening the following ports

- **80 and 443** for standard communications
- **3000** is a standard port for user projects
- **9500** is a standard SSL port for user projects

### Working from home
Sometimes the anti-virus/firewall settings on your personal devices may interfere with home usage and make the experience slow.

You should check your settings and ensure that items in the above **Firewall settings** list are added to your exclusion list.

### Connectivity Test
If you continue to experience difficulties, visit the [Connection Diagnostics](https://codio.com/connectivity/index.html) page and send us back the generated output going to **Help > Support/Contact Us** and attach the output file using the paperclip icon)

## Browser support
Codio is best experienced on the very latest browsers, in particular Chrome, but should run fine on the following browsers:

- **Chrome** 21 or later
- **Firefox** - 22 or later
- **IE** - 10 or later
- **Safari** - 6 or later
- **Opera** - 15 or later

If using **Safari** and accessing Codio via an [LMS](/courses/lti1_0/), disable "Prevent cross-site tracking" to ensure access.

![Safari settings](/img/crosssitetracking.png)

If you are experiencing any issue where Codio will not run as it should, please send an email to help@codio.com.

<a name="ie-compatibility"></a>
### Disable IE Compatibility View

It could happen that even if you have Internet Explorer 10 or a later version, we detect a older version of the browser.

This is due to the *Compatibility Mode* of the Browser which enables old features we no longer support.

To disable this option, please go to ***Tools → F12 developer tools*** and be sure that in **Browser Mode** is selected **«Internet Explorer 10»** and in **Document Mode** is selected **«Standards (Page default)»**.
## Resetting student passwords
You can change a student's password in the following way:

1. From the **Courses** area, click on your course to open it.

![authtoken](/img/manage_classes/year_10_class.png)

1. Click on the **Students** tab, top centre of your screen.

![authtoken](/img/manage_classes/students_tab.png)

1. You will see all students in your course displayed on this screen. Find the student whose password needs to be changed and click on the blue triple dot icon to the right of their name. Choose **Change students password** and follow the steps to reset.
## Forgot your password
If you have forgotten your password, you should use the **lost password** link on the log-in page or enter your email in the reset password area (see image below) to reset your password automatically via email.

**For School and University students only:** If you do not have access to the email address you used in creating your Codio account and you are a student, please contact your teacher. He or she will be able to reset your password for you.

If you wish to change your password (you should also do this if you forgot your password and it was reset) follow these steps:

1. Click on your name and gravatar (bottom left of screen)

![Profile Picture](/img/what_students_do/forgotpassword/profilepic.png)

1. From the options along the top of the page, choose **Account**

![Account settings area](/img/what_students_do/forgotpassword/account.png)

1. About halfway down the **Account** page is the **Change Password** area. The student should enter their existing password and the new password, and then click **Update password**.

![Change Password](/img/what_students_do/forgotpassword/change.png)

Three attempts are allowed before your account will be temporarily suspended. You can try again in 15 minutes

## Public key
Codio automatically generates a public key for your account. This key can then be used whenever Codio attempts communication with an external server that requires public/private key based authentication such as SSH or SFTP access.

![public key dialog](/img/prefs-account-ssh.png)


### Where is it used?
Codio makes use of the public key in the following places

- [SFTP deployment target](/project/ide/tools/deployment/#sftp-target-type)
- [RSYNC deployment target](/project/ide/tools/deployment/#rsync-target-type)
- [SSH Terminal](/project/ide/tools/ssh/)
- [Git](/project/ide/editing/#git-mercurial-svn)

In both cases, you will need to install the public key onto the remote system. In the case of SFTP, you should know how to do this already.

### Adding your public key to a remote server
If you want to get your Codio public key onto a remote server, just press the Upload Public Key button. You enter your user credentials on the remote and Codio will get it installed in the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file.

![authtoken](/img/prefs-account-ssh-dialog.png)

### Adding your public key to GitHub or BitBucket
If you are working with GitHub or BitBucket, then you need to install the public key. Codio makes this very easy for you. Goto **Codio>Account** and select GitHub or BitBucket tab and select 'Upload your public key to GitHub/BitBucket'

![SSH Public](/img/prefs-account-gh1.png)

You will be redirected to your GitHub/BitBucket account and asked to authorise the application

On accepting this you will then be redirected back to your Codio account.

## GitHub
The GitHub tab lets you associate your account with your GitHub account and where you can upload your public key. See [SSH Key](/dashboard/account/#public-key)


![SSH Public](/img/prefs-account-gh1.png)

You can sign in with GitHub as well.
## BitBucket
The BitBucket tab lets you associate your account with your BitBucket account and where you can upload your public key. See [SSH Key](/dashboard/account/#public-key)

You can sign in with BitBucket as well.


## Change account details
You can change the following settings

- **Account name** - changing this will not affect the URL associated with your account name. This name is for display and communication purposes only.
- **Email address**

![Profile Settings](/img/prefs-ac-profile.png)

## Delete your account
You can delete your account at any time from the **Codio > Account** menu item and going to the **Account** tab

![authtoken](/img/delete.png)

Please be warned that when you do finally close the account, it cannot be retrieved, nor can its contents, so please make sure you export any projects you want to keep or push the to a remote Git repo.

## Organisation Billing
![Organizations Billing](/img/organisations_billing.png)

For Schools and University organisations, the billing screen allows you to generate invoices for your account (for new accounts and renewal of existing accounts),for active subscriptions, view the details of the current plan, enter the email of the person who should receive billing notifications and also where you can switch your organisation to **Student Pay** where students are prompted to enter a credit card when they sign up.
