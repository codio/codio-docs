An organization is always required for institutional teaching. The organization area contains settings for managing accounts, LMS integration and many other organization related settings.

## Organisation overview
Interesting organization settings.

## Administrator role
As the creator of your educational organization in Codio, you have administrator rights. This means that you can add and remove [teachers](/courses/classes/#adding-teachers-to-a-class) from your organization, edit your organization information, manage your students [dashboard settings](/dashboard/organisations/#student-dashboard-settings), create [grading templates](/courses/classes/#grading-rubric-templates) and [delete](/dashboard/organisations/#delete-organization) your organization.

To access the administration tools:

1. Click on your profile picture (bottom left of **Courses**)
![Profile](/img/class_administration/profilepic.png)
1. Click the name of your school (under **My Organizations**)
![Org Name](/img/class_administration/addteachers/myschoolorg.png)
1. You will see admin options listed across the top of the page.
![Members](/img/manage_organization/memberstab.png)

## Add teachers
Once you have set up your organization, the next step is to invite teachers to use Codio too. There are 2 ways you can do this:

### Invite Teacher to the Organization

1. Click your name/gravatar, bottom of the left hand pane

    ![Profile](/img/class_administration/profilepic.png)

1. Click the name of your organization (under **My Organizations**)

    ![Org Name](/img/class_administration/addteachers/myschoolorg.png)

1. Click the **Members** tab

    ![Members](/img/manage_organization/memberstab.png)

1. In the  **Invite Teacher to the Organization** area, enter in their email address. If you also wish them to have full [access](/dashboard/organisations/#administrator-role) rights to the organization, check the **Add this teacher to owners group**.

    ![Invite Teacher](/img/manage_organization/inviteteacher.png)

1. An email will be sent to your colleague containing a link to sign up and on completion they will be added into your Organization automatically.
**N.B.** They must use the email address the invitation was sent to or they will not be added to the Organization.

1. Any invitations not completed will show in the area below and where you can also **Resend** or **Revoke** if you require. Once the invitee has joined the organization they will no longer show in this area but show in the **All Members** list below (and also **Owners** list if 'Add this teacher to owners group' was checked)

    ![Pending](/img/manage_organization/pendinginvite.png)

### Invitation Token

1. Click your name/gravatar, bottom of the left hand pane

    ![Profile](/img/class_administration/profilepic.png)

1. Click the name of your organization (under **My Organizations**)

    ![Org name](/img/class_administration/addteachers/myschoolorg.png)

1. Click the **Organization Settings** tab

    ![Org settings](/img/manage_organization/orgsettingstab.png)

1. About half way down you will see an **Invitation** area, displaying an **Invite URL** and an **Invite token**.

    ![Add Teachers](/img/class_administration/addteachers/invitation.png)

1. Give any teachers who are not already Codio users the invite URL.

1. When they enter the URL in their browser, they will automatically be taken through the sign-up process and as they select that they are a Teacher, will then be added to your Organization.

1. Alternatively, teachers can register themselves for a Codio account by following the sign-up process at www.codio.com. Once they have done this (selecting that they are a **Teacher**, they will be asked for an **Invite token** to join your educational organization. This is provided in step 4 above - give them the token (not the URL).

1. If you already have classes set up you can add and invite teachers directly into your class(es). See

    [Adding teachers to a class](/courses/classes/#adding-teachers-to-a-class)

You can then if you wish add them as an [organization owner](/dashboard/organisations/#add-organization-owners) so they can then manage and create courses themselves and have full admin access to the organization


## Add organization owners
You are the **Owner** of your organization if you created it. You can add other owners (these will usually be other teachers who you wish to give admin rights to).
There are 2 ways you can do this:

### Add a new user to your Organization Owners group

1. Click your name/gravatar, bottom of the left hand pane
![Profile](/img/class_administration/profilepic.png)

1. Click the name of your organization (under **My Organizations**)
![Org Name](/img/class_administration/addteachers/myschoolorg.png)

1. Click the **Members** tab
![Members](/img/manage_organization/memberstab.png)

1. In the  **Invite Teacher to the Organization** area, enter in their Email address and check the 'Add this teacher to owners group'.
![Invite Owner](/img/manage_organization/inviteowner.png)

1. An email will be sent to your colleague containing a link to sign up and on completion they will be added into your Organization automatically and to the **Owners** group.
**N.B.** They must use the email address the invitation was sent to or they will not be added to the Organization.

1. Any invitations not completed will show in the area below and where you can also 'Resend' or 'Revoke' if you require. Once the invitee has joined the organization they will no longer show in this area but show in the **All Members** list below and also **Owners** list.
![Pending](/img/manage_organization/pendinginviteowner.png)

### Add an existing Codio user to your Organization Owners group

1. Click your name/gravatar, bottom of the left hand pane
![Profile](/img/class_administration/profilepic.png)

1. Click on the name of your  educational organization - under **My Organizations**, which is about halfway down the screen.
![Org Name](/img/manage_organization/myschoolorg.png)

1. Click the **Members** tab
![Members](/img/manage_organization/memberstab.png)

1. Click **Owners**
![Owners](/img/manage_organization/owners.png)

You should see yourself listed as an owner. To add another teacher, choose the **Add User** drop down and as you type their Codio Username, the listing will filter down so you can then select them.
## Add students
You do not add students to an organization directly. They are added by inviting them to join a course. Please [click here](/courses/classes/#add-students-to-a-class) for more information.

Codio also creates test students so instructors are able to see how students interact with a course. This is described in the course section.

If you are using an LMS for a class then the LMS platform will handle the addition of students to the Codio class automatically.
## Student consent form
The student consent form is a feature for Codio organizations. It allows you to show an IP consent form, whose content you create yourself, to Codio users.

To configure the consent form information, click on your user name from the dashboard. Next, select your organization. You will then see the **IP Consent** tab at the top of the screen.

If you enable this feature, all students will be shown the form when they first create an account. If a student has already created an account then the next time they sign in, they will be shown the form. They will not be able to access Codio until they do consent.

![authtoken](/img/studentconsent.png)

### Creating content

![authtoken](/img/consent.png)

You should first create the content that you wish to display to the student. You enter your text in the lower portion of the screen. You can use markdown to format your text. If you are not familiar with markdown, here is a reference for markdown:

- [Daring Fireball](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics) - the author of markdown

You can press the **Save Draft** button to save your changes and continue editing later.

You can also **Preview** your changes to see how the rendered output appears.

### Publishing and revisions
You need to publish your changes so that they appear to the student. You can create new versions over time. Earlier versions of the form can be recalled by selecting the version from the drop down list.

Once you are happy with your text, you press the **Publish new version** button.

### Exporting student consent data
If you would like to download a log of all students who have consented, press the **Download CSV** link in the upper section.

The CSV file contains the following data

- User name
- Codio user ID
- Email address
- Revision of the consent form they consented to
- Date and time of the consent.
## View organization members
Sometimes you might need to check who is registered as a member of your educational organization. To view all members of your school organization follow these steps:

1. Click your name/gravatar, bottom of the left hand pane
![authtoken](/img/class_administration/profilepic.png)

1. Click on the name of your  educational organization - under **My Organizations**, which is about halfway down the screen.
![authtoken](/img/class_administration/addteachers/myschoolorg.png)

1. Click the **Members** tab
![authtoken](/img/manage_organization/memberstab.png)

1. Click **All Members**
![authtoken](/img/manage_organization/members.png)

You will be able to see all the members of your school organization.

The **Test Students** group contains the demo student accounts created for you when the Organization was created. See [Test Students](/courses/classes/#test-students) for more information.

The **Users without class** group contains all users that are not members of a class. See [Delete Class](/courses/classes/#deleting-a-class) for more information.  This may be as a result of a class being deleted or it may be that a new user has joined your organization but is not yet either a Teacher or a Student in a class.
Select this group and you can then remove these users from your organization if required.
![authtoken](/img/manage_organization/orphanedusers.png)

Please note that removing users from your Organization does not delete their Codio account. Only the account owner can [delete their account](/dashboard/account/#delete-your-account).

## Student dashboard settings
Organization owners can manage the student dashboard view by setting their default page to 'My Projects' as an alternative to **My Classroom** as well as optionally hiding **My Classroom** and **Courses** menu items.

To do this, access the administration tools:

1. Click on your profile picture (bottom left of **Classes**)
![authtoken](/img/class_administration/profilepic.png)
1. Click the name of your institution (under **My Organizations**)
![authtoken](/img/class_administration/addteachers/myschoolorg.png)
1. You will see admin options listed across the top of the page.
![authtoken](/img/manage_organization/memberstab.png)
1. Select **Dashboard Settings**
1. Make the required changes and **Update** to save the changes
![authtoken](/img/manage_organization/dash.png)

**N.B.** Your students may need to reload Codio in their browser when they next log in for the changes to be visible to them

Access for students to individual courses can also be managed in the course permissions. See [Restrict Course access](/courses/coursemanagement/#restrict-course-access) for more information.

## Custom script
To integrate third-party systems to help/track students, custom scripts can be enabled.

Enabling this will allow third-party systems (such as [sense.network](/courses/assessments/#sense-network) to help/track students.

In all cases, the `userid`,`email` and the user type (Student/Teacher) will be passed.

If required by the third-party system used, custom js code can be included in the **Custom Script** section.

Any such code should be entered without script tags.

e.g.

```javascript
var http = new XMLHttpRequest();
var url = 'https://userdomain/url'; //Change to valid URL for your third-party system
var params = 'userId=' + codio.userId ;
http.open('POST', url, true);
http.setRequestHeader('Content-type', 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded');
http.onreadystatechange = function() {//Call a function when the state changes.
    if(http.readyState == 4 && http.status == 200) {
        alert(http.responseText);
    }
}
http.send(params);
```
You can also add `console.log` entries to be able to test/view output

e.g.
```javascript
console.log('params', codio);
console.log('params', window);
console.log('params', document)
console.log(window.codio.currentPage)
console.log(window.codio.totalNumberOfPages)
```

If you require any assistance with this, please don't hesitate to [contact us](/dashboard/support/) in the usual manner.

## Remove owners
You may want to remove one or more of the owners you have set for your organization. It is worth noting that you always need at least one owner. (If you want to know how to add owners, jump to [add organization owners](/dashboard/organisations/#add-organization-owners)).

To remove owners:

1. Click your name/gravatar, bottom of the left hand pane
![authtoken](/img/class_administration/profilepic.png)

1. If you want to use the freed-up accounts with new students, follow the steps listed in [Add Users](/courses/classes/#add-students-to-a-class)
## Organization Assessments Library
In addition to Codio's global assessments library, you can create Organization assessments libraries. This allows your faculty to share assessment items with other instructors similar to how you can share Courses within an Organization.

### Create an Organization Assessments Library

1. Click your name/gravatar, bottom of the left hand pane
![Profile](/img/class_administration/profilepic.png)

1. Click the name of your organization (under **My Organizations**)
![Org Name](/img/class_administration/addteachers/myschoolorg.png)

1. Click the Assessments Library tab
![Assessments Library tab](/img/librarytab.png)

1. Click “Create a New Library”

1. Enter the name of the assessments library you want to create and press “Create”
![Assessments Library name](/img/namelibrary.png)

Read more about assessment libraries [here](courses/assessments-library/).

### Add Collaborators to an Assessments Library

* Under the Assessments Library tab, click on the library you want to add collaborators to
![Add Collaborators](/img/librarysettings.png)

<a name="orgLibPermissions"></a>
* Click on the Permissions tab.

**Add Permission:** Either type the user name or use the drop down arrow to select an organization member to give permission to. By default, the collaborators are given “Read” permission, meaning they cannot add to or edit assessments in the library. To give a user “Write” permission, simply select the permission level next to their user name in the list.

**Read Permission for Teachers:**  Turning this on allows all Teachers in the organization to have “Read” permission, meaning they cannot add to or edit assessments in the library.

![Assessments Library permissions](/img/librarypermissions.png)

**Remove:** To remove a collaborator, simply press the “Remove” button next to their user name. Please note that is “Read permission for teachers” is turned on, that user may still have read permission if they are still a teacher account and a member of the organization.
## Public/private settings
Organization owners can disable this feature to allow members of the Organization to create Public Projects/Stacks/Starter Packs/Courses and Modules. By default, these will be created as Private.


Private projects can still be shared to other users in the normal manner. See [Permissions](/ide/settings/#project-permissions)


**N.B.** Any existing Projects/Stacks/Starter Packs/Courses and Modules created by members of the organization prior to any changes being made will not be effected

To enable the creation of Public Projects/Stacks/Starter Packs/Courses and Modules, access the administration tools:

1. Click on your profile picture (bottom left of **Classes**)
![authtoken](/img/class_administration/profilepic.png)
1. Click the name of your institution (under **My Organizations**)
![authtoken](/img/class_administration/addteachers/myschoolorg.png)
1. You will see admin options listed across the top of the page.
![authtoken](/img/manage_organization/memberstab.png)
1. Select **Organization Settings**
1. Go to the Private/Public Settings area and click the slider to disable this, and **Update** to save the changes
![authtoken](/img/manage_organization/public_private.png)

Organization owners can also block Codio support team from being able to access members accounts to provide platform support.

## Gigaboxes
Codio's default boxes are allocated 400MB of memory. If you need larger boxes then you can upgrade your subscription to give access to 1GB, 2GB, 8GB,16GB and GPU (for GPU-accelerated instances) boxes.

You purchase a specific number of Gigaboxes that can be used by anyone within your organization. Codio tracks usage based on active projects rather than total projects. In other words, you can have 100 projects which use a Gigabox but as long as only one is active at a time, this requires only a single Gigabox unit to be purchased.

To see the status of your current Gigabox usage, for all users

- Click on your user name in the dashboard
- Select your organization 
- Click on the Organization Settings tab

You can then scroll down to the Gigaboxes section.
## Delete organization
If, for any reason you want to completely delete your organization, you can do so in the following way:

1. Click your name/gravatar, bottom of the left hand pane
![authtoken](/img/class_administration/profilepic.png)

1. Click on the name of your  educational organization - under **My Organizations**, which is about halfway down the screen.
![authtoken](/img/class_administration/addteachers/myschoolorg.png)

1. Click the **Organization settings** tab
![authtoken](/img/manage_organization/orgsettingstab.png)

1. Go to the **Delete** section at the bottom of the page, and type the confirmation code. Note that once your school action has been deleted, the action cannot be reverted.

## Organisation contact URL
If you wish to set your own contact URL's for your students (e.g. you have a forum or LMS discussion area for them to use or you have your own resources available to assist students), you can do so in the following way:

1. Click your name/gravatar, bottom of the left hand pane
![profile](/img/class_administration/profilepic.png)

1. Click on the name of your  educational organization - under **My Organizations**, which is about halfway down the screen.
![organisation](/img/class_administration/addteachers/myschoolorg.png)

1. Click the **Organization settings** tab
![organisation settings](/img/manage_organization/orgsettingstab.png)

1. Go to the **Education Settings** section toward the  bottom of the page, and enter the text you wish to show along with the URL you wish to direct your students to. You can set as many options as you require and also define the default option that will be checked automatically for the students.
![organisation contact url](/img/manage_organization/org_releasegrades.png)

1. If these are set, when a student uses any of the ways to contact us, they will be shown all the options in addition to contacting Codio directly if they have a problem accessing the Codio platform, or loading a unit can contact us.

![Student options](/img/manage_organization/studentoptions.png)

1. These can also be set at the [class](/courses/classes/#class-contact-url) level so if you have specific areas/forums for your classes for students to raise questions, you can set the contact URL there and it will override the organisation setting

**N.B. "Teacher" accounts will not be effected by this setting and they will still be able to contact Codio in the usual manner. See [Support](/dashboard/support/) for more on this**
## Organisation release grades
By default Students are not shown the grades until you decide to release them to the class but if you wish to automatically [Release Grades](/courses/grading/#releasing-grades) when students complete a unit, you can enable this feature so when you create new [classes](/courses/classes/#creating-a-new-class) this option is automatically enabled.

Enabling this feature will not effect existing classes
