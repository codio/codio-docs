Pencil Code is now available in Codio installing from **Tools->Install Software**

![PencilCode](/img/pencilcode.png)

With [Codio guides](/courses/authoring/) you can provide instructions for an assignment side-by-side with the Pencil Code environment.

Start by creating either a new project or assignment in your course, and going to **Tools -> Install Software** to install the **Pencil Code** server

To create an empty Pencil Code project in Codio, select **File > New** from the Codio menu and create a file with an **.pencilcode** suffix. 

You can set up your Guide to [automatically open](/courses/settings-actions/#open-tabs) files you want your students to use. If you don't want the guide to take up screen space, you can set it up to [collapse on open](/courses/authoring/#global) or students can simply click on the files in the file tree for them to open in Jeroo
