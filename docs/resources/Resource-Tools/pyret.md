Pyret is now available in Codio

![PencilCode](/img/pencilcode.png)

With [Codio guides](/courses/authoring/) you can provide instructions for an assignment side-by-side with the Pencil Code environment.

To create an empty Pyret project in Codio, select **File > New** from the Codio menu and create a file with an **.arr** suffix. 

You can set up your Guide to [automatically open](/courses/settings-actions/#open-tabs) files you want your students to use. If you don't want the guide to take up screen space, you can set it up to [collapse on open](/courses/authoring/#global) or students can simply click on the files in the file tree for them to open in Pyret
