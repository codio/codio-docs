Jeroo is now available in Codio as a [Stack](/project/stacks/).

![jeroo](/img/jeroo.png)

With [Codio guides](/courses/authoring/) you can provide instructions for an assignment side-by-side with the Jeroo environment.

Start by creating either a new project or assignment in your course, selecting the **Jeroo** stack

When created, select **File > New** from the Codio menu and create a file with an **.jev** suffix for a map file or **.jsc** for a program file. 

You can set up your Guide to [automatically open](/courses/settings-actions/#open-tabs) files you want your students to use. If you don't want the guide to take up screen space, you can set it up to [collapse on open](/courses/authoring/#global) or students can simply click on the files in the file tree for them to open in Jeroo

Jeroo files are **not saved automatically**, you must select **File > Save** to save your work.
